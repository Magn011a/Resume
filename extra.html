        <h1>Extra Curricular</h1>
        <div>In 2021, I joined a program called SEO in my Freshmen year. It's a program that helps you prepare for college, whether that be through getting you a mentor, into a program, or helping to write your college statement.</div>
        <br>
          <div> In 2022, I worked many jobs---I helped tutor kids in Algbra II, helped middle school students film and edit their interviews for their school website. In addition, I led insightful dicussions with middle schoolers about the structuring of a movie.</div>
          <br>
          <div>Afterwards, I joined another program called American On Tech, which was devoted to helping those involved with their organization with programing. They would hold in-person and somtimes virutal meetings, where we created programs like websites.</div>
          <br>
          <div>In 2023, I got an intership from a Digital Marketing company called EssenceTree. I was taked with helping with Youtube, transfering videos and shorts as well as coming up with ideas for their video introduction and things alike.</div>
          <br>
          <div>Finally, I joined a program called All Star Code, where similarly to America On Tech, I learn more coding languages.</div>
